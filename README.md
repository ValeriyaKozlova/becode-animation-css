# When?
I did this task for one day, but I should admit that It' was quite difficult.
# Why?
Because it's a good way to consolidate knowledge in the area of CSS-animation.
# How?
The first exercise "Drill" wasn't difficult and I did it very fast. But the second took a lot of time. I decided to do it with grid-rows and it was a great mistake, because when I applied *visibility:hidden* and *height:0*, the element disappeared, but the place for it remained. I tried diffrents ways to fix it, but it didn't work. So I redid it without grid-rows, and now you can see the result.
# What?

## Thank you for attention!
